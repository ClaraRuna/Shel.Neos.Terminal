## How to get rid of the sponsoring badge

Creating and maintaining a plugin like this takes a lot of time.
Therefore, I decided to add a small nagging badge to promote financial support for my work.

There are several ways to get rid of the little sponsoring badge in the terminal:

1. Get in touch with [me](sponsor@helzle.it) for direct sponsoring 100â‚¬ (excl. VAT) / registration key
2. Become a sponsor via [Github](https://github.com/sebobo) 20$+/month level
3. Become a [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/shelzle) 20$+/month level

This will help me to further develop this and other plugins.
Of course, I'll also do my best to react quickly to issues & questions.
