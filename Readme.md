# Neos CMS terminal for running Eel expressions and other commands in the UI

This package provides a Terminal plugin for the [Neos CMS](https://www.neos.io) UI.
Several commands are provided to safe time during development & debugging of Neos projects.

It uses the great [terminal component](https://github.com/linuswillner/react-console-emulator) by [Linus Willner](https://github.com/linuswillner).

## Provided commands

### Eel evaluator

The `eel` command allows you to run any Eel expression.

You can run simple expressions:

```
eel 5+2
```

Or more complex ones. The following call will return the labels of all subpages of your homepage: 

```
eel Array.map(q(site).children().get(), page => page.label)
```

By default the current `siteNode`, `documentNode` and currently selected `node` are
available in your expression context.

### Flush caches

The `flushCache` command allows you to flush all or a single cache.

F.e. the following call will flush the Fusion rendering cache:

```
flushCache Neos_Fusion_Content
```

## Configuration

### Enabling the plugin in Production context 

By default, the plugin is only loaded in *Development* context.
If you want to have it active in *Production* you have to override the setting in your `Settings.yaml`:

```yaml
Neos:
  Neos:
    Ui:
      frontendConfiguration:
        'Shel.Neos.Terminal:Terminal':
          enabled: true
```

### Theming

Have a look at the [Settings.yaml](Configuration/Settings.yaml) in this package and its `frontendConfiguration`.
It allows you to override the theme with your own.

### Command policies

By default any *Administrator* has full access to all existing and added commands.

Additionally the role `Shel.Neos.Terminal:TerminalUser` exists which can only run the `eel` command by default.
You can add more privileges to this role to allow more commands.
See [Policy.yaml](Configuration/Policy.yaml) in this package for examples.

## Adding your own commands

Adding your commands is quite easy (depending on what you plan to do).

Create a new class named `MyCommand` and implement the `TerminalCommandControllerPluginInterface` from 
this package. As soon as you implemented all required methods your good to go!

As an example you can create a command to show the joke of the day with the following class.
Just adapt the namespace depending on your own package key.

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Vendor\Package\Command;

use Neos\ContentRepository\Domain\Model\NodeInterface;
use Neos\Flow\Http\Client\Browser;
use Neos\Flow\Http\Client\CurlEngine;
use Shel\Neos\Terminal\Command\CommandInvocationResult;
use Shel\Neos\Terminal\Command\TerminalCommandControllerPluginInterface;

class JokeCommand implements TerminalCommandControllerPluginInterface
{

    public static function getCommandName(): string
    {
        return 'jod';
    }

    public static function getCommandDescription(): string
    {
        return 'Joke of the day';
    }

    public static function getCommandUsage(): string
    {
        return 'jod [<string>]';
    }

    public function invokeCommand(
        string $argument,
        NodeInterface $siteNode = null,
        NodeInterface $documentNode = null,
        NodeInterface $focusedNode = null
    ): CommandInvocationResult
    {
        $browser = new Browser();
        $browser->setRequestEngine(new CurlEngine());
        $jokeResponse = json_decode($browser->request('https://api.jokes.one/jod')->getBody()->getContents());
        $joke = $jokeResponse->contents->jokes[0]->joke;

        $result = $joke->title . ': ' . $joke->text;

        return new CommandInvocationResult(true, $result);
    }
}
```

## Supporting this plugin / how to get rid of the sponsorship badge

Creating and maintaining a plugin like this takes a lot of time.
Therefore, I decided to add a small nagging badge to promote financial support for my work.

There are several ways to get rid of the little sponsoring badge in the terminal:

1. Get in touch with [me](sponsor@helzle.it) for direct sponsoring 100â‚¬ (excl. VAT) / registration key
2. Become a sponsor via [Github](https://github.com/sebobo) 20$+/month level
3. Become a [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/shelzle) 20$+/month level

This will help me to further develop this and other plugins.
Of course, I'll also do my best to react quickly to issues & questions.
